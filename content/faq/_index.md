## So, you offer consulting for remote and distributed teams?

Yes! My mission is to work closely with hiring or leaders managing remote teams and help them set the foundational pieces to make their team and culture as healthy as possible to perform in a remote work environment. Think of us like your sidekick.

## I don't know where I need to improve. I don't even know where to start with managing my own remote team. 

That's okay, you're in the right place. Through my years of experience working remote in different settings, varying work cultures and all kinds of talented people I have gathered a framework that will support you. 

My first step in getting started is understanding your pain points and challenges. From there I'll observe how you and your team communicates and after that we'll brainstorm on how to remedy those pain points. 

My goal is help you connect the foundational pieces so that you can carry on your own after our consulting ends. I want to empower you to create the best environment for your team.

## We're drowning with work and we don't have time to sit down, evaluate, document and set up systems. 

That's where I'll come in. I'll be that extra support a few hours a month or a week to build a system for your team.

## Do you offer an initial consultation call?

I sure do. It's free, 15mins and we'll discuss how we can get going. This is also the perfect time to ensure you and I are the right fit to work together.

## What's the best way to reach you?

You may email me [here](mailto:irma@techbizdesign.xyz)

## What's this community thing you speak of?

Haha! Yes, so I wanted to bring us remote managers, entrepreneurs, makers and more into one space. We'd love to see you join, find our community [here](https://discord.gg/AbMeHej). All we ask is to please be respectful to others and not to spam or overly self-promote.
