# Welcome to TechBizDesign – a consultancy and community for you.

My name is Irma! I started TechBizDesign as a way to help and support hiring managers, CEOs, entrepreneurs, engineering managers, and more to build and maintain healthy remote/distributed teams.

A lot comes with working remote and managing a distributed team, from developing and structuring onboarding, to choosing the right communication tools and most importantly creating an environment that creates community.

### Here are a few ways I can help you and your team:  

- Documentation for on-boarding remote employees
- Using a “buddy system” for on-boarding and culture building
- Ways to build a distributed team from the ground up
- Managing distributed teams whether full-time or contract
- Evaluating the structure and performance of a distributed team
- 1:1 prep to help you find and be successful in a remote role
- Practicing empathy within a distributed team

To get started, you can [email me here](mailto:irma@techbizdesign.xyz) or set up a 15-min introductory call [here](https://calendly.com/techbizdesign) where we can discuss your pain points and goals.

### On top of remote consulting, we have a Discord community

Our discord community aims to bring together a core group of folks working directly with remote teams and create a safe space to get advice, tips, and share experiences. 

If you'd like to join, [here's](https://discord.gg/AbMeHej) your invite.
