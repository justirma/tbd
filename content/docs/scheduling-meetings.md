## So you're having trouble with meetings, huh?

It's a problem a lot of us have. I have yet to meet 1 person who has meetings, scheduling them, etc. to work perfectly.

In the meantime, while that is being figured out, [here](https://blog.flexiple.com/schedule-meetings-like-a-boss/) is a great post by Flexiple on how you can schedule meetings like a BOSS.

[Tweet](https://twitter.com/_justirma) me if this was helpful! Or with suggestions about what you'd like to see out of our resources.
